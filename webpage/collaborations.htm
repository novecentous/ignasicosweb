Although decision-making may rank as one of the most broadly studied research topics, there is significant controversy about whether decisions are made on a progressive accumulation of evidence or whether there are additional physiological principles implemented by an urgency signal, which biases the commitment during decision-making. My contribution to the project is a computational model, in collaboration with Dr. David Thura, aimed at explaining behavioural pattern of choices of two non-human primates recorded by the <a href="http://www.cisek.org/pavel/" target=_blank>Cisek Lab</a> while performing a sensory decision-making task consisting of making choices between a right and a left target as a function of sensory evidence. Our hypothesis is that their behaviour responds to a principle of reward/effort maximisation.

<td align=top><b>2. Dr. David Robbe, Institut de Neurobiologie de la Mediterranee (INMED)</b>. If we decide the velocity, movement time and force prior to any movement we make, it may be considered that moving is a decision-making process, and therefore that some of the trade-offs that have been observed in more abstract decision-making contexts may also apply to motor control. Specifically, I am designing a computational model to test whether the behavioural structure exhibited by some rodents to solve locomotion task is consistent with a speed-accuracy trade-off between effort and the likelihood of being rewarded, and to investigate the principles of optimality selected by the rodents in this case David Robbe and Pavel Rueda-Orozco at the <a href="http://www.inmed.univ-mrs.fr/index.php?page=15&id=32" target=_blank>INMED of Marseille</a>.

<td align=top><b>3. Encarni Marcos, SPECS, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona</b>. One of the fundamental aspects of the brain is that it originated to control movement. Consequently, the basics of its neuroanatomy, which are common across species largely diverse, have evolved to generate and control movement. In the context of decision-making processes, the question we are addressing here is whether the contribution of the motor system to make decisions about options based on information independent of the motor system are still influenced by biomechanical costs, hence, costs related to the motor system. To this end, <a href="http://specs.upf.edu/people/341" target=_blank>Encarni Marcos</a> and myself are conducting preliminary experiments and building a computational model using a decision-making paradigm based on visual information, while using two motor movements of opposite biomechanical cost to report the choices. Is the motor system still exerting an influence on the choices although its contribution is not required? In other words, are we unable to operate independently of the motor system?

<td align=top><b>4. Dr. Julie Duque, Institute of Neuroscience, UCL,Belgium</b>. When we have to make decisions between two movements involving different distances and biomechanical costs. How do we integrate these two sensory modalities to select and implement the resulting motor movement? I am trying to respond to this question in collaboration with <a href="http://www.julieduque.be" target=_blank>Julie Duque</a> by performing a decision-making task between two reaching movements of different biomechanical cost while applying single pulse TMS onto the primary motor cortex. My prediction is that both sources of sensory information must be rapidly merged into the motor system to implement the selected movement.
